Brass Notes is the app to quickly check the position or fingering of a note while practicing! Instruments included are the trombone, euphonium, trumpet, tuba, and french horn.  Also works for other instruments if you need to transpose music or if you're wondering what a note name for a certain note is!   Want something more included? Write a review and add something you'd like and we'll try out best!  Situation: You are in band practice. You see an odd note that you haven't played before. You don't know how to play it. Answer: You get out your brass notes app and quickly check without the conductor even noticing! Someone else asking what that note is? Tell them! At home practicing and unsure what it is? Don't look it up on the internet or a book, just take out your Brass Notes app!  Thanks for all the support!
